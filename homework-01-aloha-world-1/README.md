capacity.

Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)
> - **StackOverflow**

(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
> - My favorite part of the assignment was building the `Greeting` class from the Javadoc and then seeing all the unit tests pass. It was satisfying to take a written specification and turn it into working code, especially since the tests clearly showed when things were correct.

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
